# Action Tooltip System Implementation Guide

## Prompt 1: Create the Action Tooltip Foundation
Create a new action tooltip system for the Virtual MIDI Controller that replaces the keyboard speed tooltip with a more comprehensive "last major action" confirmation system. 

REQUIREMENTS:
- Add a new member variable `actionTooltipLabel` to replace `movementSpeedLabel` in DebugMidiController.h
- Position it in the same location as the current keyboard speed tooltip (bottom-left area)
- Use the same Blueprint styling: textSecondary color, background color, scaled font (10.0f)
- Add a method `updateActionTooltip(const juce::String& message)` that sets the label text
- Initialize with an empty state or default message like "Ready"
- Maintain the same visual appearance and positioning as the current keyboard speed tooltip

The tooltip should show the most recent significant user action until the next action replaces it. Do not implement specific action tracking yet - just create the foundation UI component and update method.

CONTEXT: This is part of a larger JUCE-based MIDI controller with existing Blueprint-style UI. The current keyboard speed tooltip will be absorbed into this new system.

## Prompt 2: Implement Keyboard Speed Integration
Integrate keyboard speed changes into the new action tooltip system in the Virtual MIDI Controller.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Remove the old keyboard speed tooltip display logic from `updateKeyboardSpeedDisplay()`
- Modify the keyboard speed change detection to call `updateActionTooltip()` instead
- Format the message as "Keyboard Speed: [X]" where X is the current speed value
- Ensure this triggers whenever the keyboard speed is changed (both up/down key presses)
- The action should appear immediately when speed changes and remain until next action

CONTEXT: The keyboard controller system already has speed change detection. Look for existing keyboard speed handling in `setupKeyboardController()` and related key press handlers. The tooltip should show confirmation that the speed change was processed.

TECHNICAL NOTES: 
- The keyboard speed is managed by the KeyboardController system
- Speed changes should trigger the action tooltip immediately
- Keep the same speed change logic, just route the confirmation through the new tooltip

## Prompt 3: Add Automation Action Tracking
Add automation-related action confirmations to the action tooltip system in the Virtual MIDI Controller.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Track automation configuration saves: "Automation Config Saved: [ConfigName]"
- Track automation configuration loads: "Automation Config Loaded: [ConfigName]" 
- Track automation configuration deletions: "Automation Config Deleted: [ConfigName]"
- Track automation start/stop: "Automation Started" / "Automation Stopped"
- All messages should appear immediately when the action occurs

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- AutomationConfigManager save/load/delete operations
- AutomationEngine start/stop methods
- Look for existing callbacks or add new ones to trigger tooltip updates

CONTEXT: The project has a sophisticated automation system with configuration management. Users need confirmation that their automation actions (save/load/delete configs, start/stop automation) were successfully processed.

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- The automation system uses callback patterns - leverage existing callbacks or add new ones
- Configuration names should be truncated if too long for display
- Automation start/stop should be tracked at the engine level

## Prompt 4: Add Reset and Settings Action Tracking
Add reset operations and settings change confirmations to the action tooltip system in the Virtual MIDI Controller.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Track slider resets: "[SliderName] - Reset" (individual slider resets)
- Track general resets: "All Sliders Reset" (if there's a reset-all function)
- Track settings changes: "Setting Changed: [SettingName]" for significant setting modifications
- Track Sec/Beat toggle: "Timing Mode: Seconds" / "Timing Mode: Beats"

SLIDER-SPECIFIC FORMAT:
- All slider-related actions must follow the format "(Slider Name) - Action"
- Use the slider's display name/label, not just "Slider X"
- Examples: "(Volume) - Reset", "(Filter Cutoff) - Reset"

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Individual slider reset functionality in SimpleSliderControl
- Settings changes in SettingsWindow (focus on major settings, not every small change)
- Sec/Beat toggle functionality (look for timing mode switches)

CONTEXT: Users need confirmation that reset operations completed and that significant setting changes were applied. Focus on actions that meaningfully change the controller state.

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Avoid tracking trivial settings changes (minor adjustments) - focus on mode switches and resets
- Slider names should come from their actual labels/configuration
- Settings changes should only track significant modifications, not every field update

## Prompt 5: Final Integration and Polish
Complete the action tooltip system integration and add any remaining action confirmations for the Virtual MIDI Controller.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Review all major user actions and ensure appropriate tooltip confirmations
- Add any missing integrations for actions that "need confirmation they happened"
- Implement proper text truncation for long messages (max width consideration)
- Add fade-in animation or brief highlight when tooltip updates (optional enhancement)
- Ensure thread safety for tooltip updates from different systems

EXCLUDED ACTIONS (do not track these):
- Slider value changes (moving sliders)
- Knob rotations  
- Bank switching
- 4/8 slider display toggle
- Settings/Learn button presses (opening windows)
- MIDI Monitor related actions
- Settings tab changes

FINAL TESTING:
- Verify all tracked actions appear immediately
- Confirm tooltip positioning matches original keyboard speed location
- Test that messages persist until next action
- Validate slider-specific format: "(Slider Name) - Action"

CONTEXT: This completes the action confirmation system that helps users understand their actions were processed. The system should feel responsive and informative without being overwhelming.

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Consider message priority if multiple actions happen rapidly
- Ensure consistent formatting across all action types
- Test with both 4-slider and 8-slider display modes
